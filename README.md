# Weekly Scheduler

## Description
What was your motivation? My motivation was to be able to successfully apply jquery and apply 3rd party open source resources to projects I may have like bootstrap and moment.
Why did you build this project? I built this project so that busy individuals could have somewhere to organize their busy day to day schedule at a 9-5.
What problem does it solve? It solves the problem of not being organized and eliminates paper usage.
What did you learn? To be quite honest I learned a lot, I really didnt fully understand jquery at first but now that I have gotten to apply it, I understand. I leanred that order of sources matter as well.
